**Clustron Zaris is a high-performance distributed key-value store for
.NET designed for modern microservices and cloud-native applications.**

It provides a scalable data platform that combines **distributed
storage, distributed coordination primitives, and multi-key
transactions** in a single system.

Clustron is designed for developers building **high-throughput .NET
services** that require:

-   distributed data storage
-   low-latency operations
-   horizontal scalability
-   strong consistency
-   operational simplicity

Clustron Zaris can serve as a **distributed key-value store for .NET
applications and as an alternative to Redis for many workloads**,
especially when **transactions and distributed primitives** are
required.

Unlike many distributed data stores that focus purely on caching,
Clustron provides a **distributed data foundation** capable of
supporting application state, coordination, and real-time data systems.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What is Clustron Zaris?

Clustron Zaris is a **distributed key-value database built specifically
for the .NET ecosystem**.

It enables applications to store and manage data across multiple nodes
while providing built-in support for **distributed coordination
primitives and transactional updates**.

Clustron combines several capabilities typically spread across multiple
infrastructure systems:

-   distributed key-value storage
-   distributed locking
-   distributed counters
-   distributed watches
-   transactional state updates

This allows developers to build **reliable distributed systems without
introducing additional infrastructure components**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Redis Alternative for .NET

Clustron Zaris can serve as an alternative to Redis for .NET applications that require **distributed coordination primitives and multi-key transactions**.

While Redis is widely used as an in-memory data store, Clustron focuses on providing a **distributed systems foundation for .NET applications** with built-in primitives that simplify building reliable distributed systems.

# Install Clustron Server

To run a local cluster, follow the **server installation guide**:

📖 Server Setup Guide\
https://github.com/zeroheartbeat/clustron-dkv/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md

The guide walks you through:

-   Installing the Clustron server
-   Starting cluster nodes
-   Creating a store
-   Connecting client applications

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Try It Now

### Install .NET Client

Install the Clustron client from NuGet:

``` bash
dotnet add package Clustron.Zaris.Client
```

Using Clustron from a .NET application is simple.

### Connect to a cluster

``` csharp
using Clustron.Zaris.Client;

var client = await ZarisClient.InitializeRemote(
    clusterId: "teststore",
    remoteHost: "127.0.0.1",
    remotePort: 7070);
```

### Store and retrieve data

``` csharp
await client.PutAsync("user:1", "John");

var value = await client.GetAsync<string>("user:1");

Console.WriteLine(value);
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Atomic counters

``` csharp
await client.IncrementAsync("global:counter");
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Distributed locking

``` csharp
using var lease = await client.AcquireLeaseAsync(
    "order-lock",
    TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10));

if (lease != null)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Lock acquired");
}
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Distributed transactions

Clustron supports **multi-key transactional updates across the
cluster**.

``` csharp
await using var tx = await client.BeginTransactionAsync();

await tx.PutAsync("account:A", 900);
await tx.PutAsync("account:B", 1100);

await tx.CommitAsync();
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Watch for changes

``` csharp
await client.WatchPrefixAsync("config:", change =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Key changed: {change.Key}");
});
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ⭐ Key Feature: Distributed Transactions

One of the strongest capabilities of Clustron Zaris is **transaction
support in a distributed key-value store**.

Many distributed KV systems either:

-   do not support transactions
-   only support single-key atomic operations
-   provide weak transactional guarantees

Clustron provides **client-coordinated distributed transactions**
enabling:

-   multi-key reads and writes
-   atomic commit across nodes
-   conflict detection
-   consistent state updates

This makes Clustron suitable for workloads such as:

-   financial transaction processing
-   distributed state management
-   inventory updates
-   multi-entity consistency workflows

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Distributed Primitives Built In

Clustron Zaris provides a distributed systems foundation with support for:

-   Distributed key-value storage
-   Native clustering
-   Prefix-based watch subscriptions
-   Lease and distributed locking primitives
-   Counters and atomic operations
-   TTL expiration via TimeWheel scheduler
-   Equality and range indexing
-   Query execution engine
-   Horizontal scaling support
-   Multi-instance per host deployment

These primitives allow developers to build distributed systems without
additional infrastructure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Typical Use Cases

Clustron Zaris can be used in many distributed system scenarios:

-   Distributed caching for .NET applications
-   Redis alternative for .NET workloads
-   Distributed job queues
-   Global rate limiting
-   Distributed leader election
-   Configuration distribution
-   Transactional application state storage
-   Service coordination between microservices

Because Clustron supports **multi-key transactions**, it can also
support **operational data workloads**, not just caching.
