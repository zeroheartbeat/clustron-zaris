# Clustron Dictus Architecture

## Overview

Clustron Dictus is a distributed, .NET-native key-value data engine designed for high-throughput, low-latency workloads in modern microservice environments.

The system is built around:

* Horizontal scalability
* Clear separation of control and data responsibilities
* Extensible internal engine components
* Predictable performance under load
* Instance-level isolation

Clustron Dictus is evolving into a distributed data foundation rather than a simple cache.

                |  (.NET Applications)  |
                +-----------+-----------+
                            |

                |  Expiration Engine    |
                |  Watch Engine         |
                |  Lease / Lock Engine  |
                +-----------+-----------+
                            |
                            v
                +-----------------------+
                |   Peer Dictus Nodes      |
                +-----------------------+
```

Each node operates as an independent process and participates in cluster coordination.

## Control Plane vs Data Plane

Clustron Dictus separates responsibilities into:

### Data Plane

Responsible for:

* Key-value operations (Get, Put, Delete)
* Prefix queries
* Watch subscriptions
* TTL enforcement
* Index lookups
* Query execution
* Lease and locking primitives
* Counter operations

Data Plane is optimized for:

* Throughput
* Minimal GC pressure
* Efficient async networking
* Low overhead serialization

---

### Control Plane

Responsible for:

* Store creation
* Instance lifecycle management
* Cluster configuration
* Port management
* Instance isolation
* Node startup and shutdown
* Configuration templates

Each Dictus instance:

* Runs independently
* Has its own configuration
* Has isolated logging
* Can be deployed multiple times per host

This separation ensures operational clarity and horizontal scalability.

---

## Node Architecture

Each Clustron Dictus node contains the following core components:

### 1. Request Pipeline

Handles incoming client requests and routes them to appropriate engine components.

Designed for:

* Async I/O efficiency
* Minimal context switching
* Backpressure handling
* Structured error propagation

---

### 2. Segment Store

The core in-memory storage engine.

Responsibilities:

* Key partitioning
* Concurrent access management
* Data layout optimization
* Efficient memory usage

Segment-based partitioning allows scalable concurrency without global locking.

---

### 3. Index Manager

Provides:

* Equality indexing
* Range indexing
* Query acceleration
* Efficient lookup paths

Indexes are maintained alongside primary storage to avoid full scans for query operations.

---

### 4. Expiration Engine (TimeWheel-Based)

Clustron Dictus uses a TimeWheel-inspired expiration model for TTL handling.

Benefits:

* O(1) expiration scheduling
* Predictable cleanup cost
* Reduced per-key timer overhead
* Avoids expensive scanning

This design improves performance under large TTL workloads.

---

### 5. Watch Engine

Supports prefix-based watch subscriptions.

Capabilities:

* Subscription to key prefixes
* Event delivery on mutations
* Snapshot + live event support
* Ordered event propagation

Designed for building reactive distributed systems.

---

### 6. Lease and Lock Engine

Provides distributed coordination primitives:

* Leases
* Lock acquisition
* Expiry-based coordination
* Safe release mechanisms

These primitives enable higher-level distributed workflows.

---

### 7. Counter Engine

Supports atomic distributed counters with:

* Increment
* Decrement
* Read
* TTL support

Designed for metrics, throttling, and coordination scenarios.

---

## Cluster Model

Clustron Dictus nodes form a logical cluster.

Key characteristics:

* Peer-to-peer coordination
* Node-aware routing
* Failure detection
* Rebalancing support (planned)
* Configurable priority-based reconnect behavior

Clients maintain:

* Priority server list
* Reconnect delay strategy
* Failover handling

Cluster design emphasizes consistency of operations within node ownership boundaries while maintaining horizontal scalability.

---

## Multi-Instance Deployment

Clustron Dictus supports multiple instances per machine.

Each instance:

* Runs on its own port
* Has isolated configuration
* Maintains independent logs
* Can be independently started/stopped

This enables:

* Resource partitioning
* Environment isolation
* Controlled multi-tenant deployments

---

## Networking Model

The networking layer is designed for:

* High-throughput async operations
* Efficient socket usage
* Controlled connection lifecycles
* Graceful failover handling

The architecture avoids unnecessary abstraction layers to reduce overhead.

---

## Scalability Philosophy

Clustron Dictus is built around:

* Horizontal scale-out
* Stateless client design
* Predictable memory behavior
* Controlled coordination overhead
* Modular extensibility

The system is intentionally structured to allow future expansion into:

* Advanced query capabilities
* Observability integration
* Vector and similarity search
* Distributed job scheduling
* Additional distributed primitives

---

## Observability (Planned Enhancements)

Future improvements include:

* Built-in metrics export
* Prometheus integration
* Per-instance performance tracking
* Cluster health reporting
* Operation tracing

---

## Design Principles

Clustron Dictus follows these principles:

* Performance-first
* Predictability over abstraction
* Extensibility without rewriting core engine
* Clear separation of responsibilities
* Operational clarity
* Practical distributed systems engineering

---

## Current Status

Clustron Dictus is in active development.

Core engine stabilization and documentation publication are ongoing.

Public open-source release of the core engine is planned for 2026 under a Business Source License.
