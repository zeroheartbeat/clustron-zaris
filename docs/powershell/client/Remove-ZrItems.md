# Remove-ZrItems

## Synopsis

Deletes multiple items from a **Clustron Distributed Key‑Value (Zaris)
store** in a single operation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Syntax

``` powershell
Remove-ZrItems [-Keys] <string[]>
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Description

`Remove-ZrItems` deletes multiple keys from a Clustron store in a
single batch operation.

Bulk deletion is significantly more efficient than issuing multiple
`Remove-ZrItem` commands individually because the request is executed
as a **single cluster operation**.

If a key does not exist, the operation still succeeds and reports that
the key was not deleted.

Typical use cases include:

-   clearing groups of cache entries
-   removing multiple sessions
-   deleting distributed state
-   batch cleanup of application keys

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Parameters

## -Keys

Specifies the keys to delete.

``` powershell
Type: String[]
Mandatory: True
Position: 0
ValueFromPipeline: True
ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName: True
```

Example:

``` powershell
Remove-ZrItems -Keys "user:1","user:2","user:3"
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Output

Returns one object per key describing the result of the delete
operation.

  Property    Description

  Deleted     Indicates whether the key existed and was deleted
  Revision    Revision after deletion

# Examples

## Delete multiple keys

``` powershell
Remove-ZrItems -Keys "session:1","session:2","session:3"

## Delete keys from pipeline

``` powershell

# Notes

-   Bulk deletion is **more efficient than multiple single deletes**.
-   Missing keys are **not treated as errors**.
-   Each key produces its own result object.
-   Press **Ctrl+C** to cancel the operation safely.
