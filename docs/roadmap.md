# Clustron Dictus Roadmap

## Vision

Clustron Dictus is being developed as a high-performance, .NET-native distributed data foundation.

The roadmap is structured around progressive stabilization, public preview, and controlled expansion into advanced distributed primitives.

---

# Phase 0 — Internal Stabilization (Current)

Focus: Engine maturity and architectural validation.

### Core Engine

* Stabilize key-value operations
* Improve memory layout and GC behavior
* Refine segment-based concurrency model
* Harden error propagation paths

### Clustering

* Improve node join/leave handling
* Strengthen failover behavior
* Priority-based client reconnect refinement

### Expiration

* TimeWheel tuning
* Expiration accuracy validation under load
* Cleanup performance improvements

### Watch & Events

* Prefix subscription stabilization
* Snapshot + live event consistency improvements
* Backpressure handling validation

### Documentation

* Publish architecture documentation
* Publish benchmark methodology
* Public roadmap publication

---

# Phase 1 — Public Preview

Focus: Controlled external evaluation.

### Engine Enhancements

* Query execution improvements
* Index consistency guarantees
* Counter stability refinements
* Lease reliability improvements

### Operational Readiness

* Logging improvements
* Per-instance metrics collection
* Config validation enhancements
* Startup and shutdown robustness

### Developer Experience

* Public preview release package
* Sample client applications
* Getting started documentation
* Configuration guides

### Licensing

* Prepare Business Source License release model
* Define additional use grants
* Document future conversion license terms

---

# Phase 2 — Production-Ready Core

Focus: Enterprise-grade reliability.

### Performance

* Load testing under sustained high concurrency
* Memory optimization passes
* Network pipeline tuning
* Reduced allocation hot paths

### Cluster Evolution

* Rebalancing strategy definition
* Node ownership clarity
* Failure scenario hardening

### Observability

* Prometheus metrics integration
* Cluster health endpoints
* Node performance reporting
* Operation-level metrics

### Operational Tooling

* CLI enhancements
* Instance diagnostics commands
* Health inspection tooling

---

# Phase 3 — Advanced Distributed Primitives

Focus: Expansion beyond basic key-value storage.

Planned exploration areas:

* Advanced query capabilities
* Aggregation support
* Enhanced indexing models
* Vector similarity search primitives
* Extended distributed coordination patterns
* Data migration tools
* Multi-tenant isolation strategies

These features will be introduced incrementally based on performance and stability criteria.

---

# Phase 4 — Ecosystem Expansion

Focus: Long-term distributed data platform.

* Management service improvements
* Web-based administrative console
* Cloud deployment templates
* Kubernetes deployment strategy
* Integration libraries
* SDK refinements
* Automation tooling

---

# Licensing Plan

Clustron Dictus core engine public release is planned under a Business Source License (BSL).

The BSL model will:

* Allow source visibility
* Restrict unlicensed commercial production use
* Convert to a permissive open-source license after a defined time period

Detailed licensing terms will be published prior to public release.

---

# Non-Goals (For Now)

To maintain focus, Clustron Dictus will not initially target:

* Multi-datacenter replication
* Cross-region geo-distribution
* Strong global consensus systems
* Full relational database capabilities

These areas may be explored in the future but are not short-term priorities.

---

# Guiding Principles

* Performance over feature bloat
* Measured, incremental expansion
* Stability before scale
* Clarity over complexity
* Engineering discipline over marketing hype

---

# Status

Clustron Dictus is currently in active development and internal validation.

Public preview milestones will be announced as stabilization targets are achieved.
