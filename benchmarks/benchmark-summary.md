# Clustron Zaris – Benchmark Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes early internal benchmarking results for Clustron Zaris.

The goal of these benchmarks is to:

* Validate architectural assumptions
* Measure throughput under controlled conditions
* Identify performance bottlenecks
* Establish baseline performance targets

These results are preliminary and subject to change as the engine evolves.

---

## Test Environment

### Hardware

* CPU: 8-core x64 processor
* RAM: 32 GB
* Storage: NVMe SSD
* Network: Localhost (no external network latency)

### Software

* Operating System: Windows Server (x64)
* .NET Runtime: .NET 8
* Build Configuration: Release
* GC Mode: Server GC

---

## Test Configuration

### Cluster Setup

* 1 Zaris server node
* Clients running on same machine
* Local loopback networking

### Workload Characteristics

* Object size: ~100 bytes
* Read/Write ratio: 70% reads / 30% writes
* Key distribution: Uniform
* TTL: Disabled (unless specified)
* Watch subscriptions: Disabled (unless specified)

---

## Test Scenario 1 – Single Client Application

* Client instances: 1
* Concurrency: Configured to saturate server
* Duration: Sustained test

### Observed Throughput

~55,000 requests per second (RPS)

### Observations

* CPU utilization increased predictably
* No unexpected memory spikes
* Stable request latency under sustained load
* No observed request drops

---

## Test Scenario 2 – Multiple Client Applications

* Client instances: 3
* Total concurrent load increased
* Same server node

### Observed Throughput

~112,000 total requests per second (RPS)

### Observations

* Throughput scaled but not linearly
* Server-side contention became visible under higher concurrency
* Indicates areas for further concurrency refinement

---

## Preliminary Analysis

The benchmarks indicate:

* Efficient baseline throughput for single-node deployment
* Predictable scaling behavior under additional client load
* Areas for improvement in multi-client contention scenarios
* Stable memory behavior under sustained traffic

These results validate the core engine design and guide upcoming optimization work.

---

## What These Benchmarks Do Not Represent

To maintain clarity and transparency:

* These are single-node results only
* No cross-node replication measured
* No network latency simulation applied
* No multi-machine cluster testing included
* No comparison against Redis, NCache, or other systems yet

Future benchmarking will include:

* Multi-node cluster scenarios
* TTL-heavy workloads
* Watch-heavy workloads
* Mixed query + KV workloads
* Comparative benchmarking

---

## Methodology Notes

Benchmark tooling used:

* Dedicated stress client
* Controlled concurrency ramp-up
* Sustained load testing (not burst-only)
* Release-mode binaries only
* Monitoring via OS-level metrics

Benchmark scripts and test configurations will be published in this directory in future revisions.

---

## Next Optimization Targets

Based on early profiling:

* Concurrency refinement in segment coordination
* Reduction of hot-path allocations
* Network pipeline tuning
* Index maintenance cost reduction
* Further GC pressure minimization

---

## Disclaimer

These benchmarks represent early-stage internal performance measurements.

Performance numbers are subject to change as the engine evolves.

Users are encouraged to perform independent benchmarking in their own environments once public preview builds are available.
